# Weather_App_Using_Flask
This app is to get weather data using flask and python

This was a personal learning project of mine to learn Python and Flask integration.
Through this project one can learn the basics of Flask, HTML, CSS and basics of API call.

Weather Data is retrieved through API call to Open Weather Website.

# Step-01:
Create a free account at https://openweathermap.org/, and get the free API id that the site provides
The API id is stored in Config.ini file for further usage.
# Step-02:
Get the api-url template from the website which will be used in the project.
# Step-03:
Now its time for Coding.
You can find the main coding in app.py file
HTML files are in templates folder and css files are in static/styles folder
